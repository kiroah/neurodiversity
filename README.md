# Neurodiversity datasets & analysis

This repository to store datasets, analysis and projects related to neurodiversity data

## Datasets
* [NHIS](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm) (National Health Interview Survey) - National survey done at USA annually since 1957, done through personal household interviews. Current dataset only covers from 2019 which is when the made major restructuring of the survey

## Projects
* [Reddit autism subthread](https://github.com/kiroah/neurodiversity/tree/main/reddit_autism) -  Project to classify Reddit posts written by people with ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) without revealing the content, but only use POS (e.g. noun, verb, etc) information. The project was done NOT to discriminate people with ASD, but instead help find adults (or late teen) without formal diagnosis. After data exploration and feature engineering, few models were [built](https://github.com/kiroah/neurodiversity/blob/main/reddit_autism/reddit_autism.ipynb) with accurancy of ~63%. Neural network (RNN) method was also [built](https://github.com/kiroah/neurodiversity/blob/main/reddit_autism/reddit_autism_NN.ipynb) with better accuracy of 70%.
